#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is essentially discipline that  applies  mathematic and scientific principles(engineering), Methods and tools to the development maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.Forming the essential infrastructure of the technology industry and powering modern life by developing applications and systems that drive communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare. Examples of software engineering products include developing operating systems : Windows, macOS, web applications (e.g., Facebook, Google), mobile apps (e.g., Instagram, Uber), and embedded systems (e.g., automotive software, IoT devices),cloud services.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Emergence of Cloud Coputing (Early 2000s):
This is where cloud computing began to take its modern form.2006: Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched EC2, a pivotal moment that made on-demand computing resources widely available.
2.The 1990s transitioned the internet to public access. Berners-Lee's World Wide Web made it user-friendly, and browsers spurred adoption. This decade also saw crucial internet commercialization.

3.The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Recent Years):
The development of models like those behind ChatGPT and Google's Gemini has marked a major advancement. These models have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human-like text, significantly impacting how we interact with technology. Specifically the years around 2022-2024 have shown very rapid advancements in this field
 This is often seen as a major turning point. Â  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
he Software Development Life Cycle
1.Requirements: collecting, understanding and documenting user system requirements.
2.Designing: a high level software's architecture and interface.
3. Implimentation: coding and building the application.
4. Testing: ensures quality and functionality before deployment to users
5. Maintenance: provides support, updates, and enhancements software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: A linear, phase-based methodology where each stage progresses sequentially.
Agile: An iterative, collaborative approach prioritizing flexibility and responsiveness to changes.
Scrum: An Agile framework using short iterations (sprints) and self-managing teams.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developers create and implement software solutions through code development and system integration
2.Quality Assurance Engineers safeguard software quality by developing and executing comprehensive test plans, identifying defects, and ensuring adherence to quality standards
3.Project Managers are responsible for the comprehensive oversight of software projects, from initial planning and resource allocation through development, testing, and successful delivery
4.System Architects create strategic blueprints for software systems, designing robust architectures that align with business requirements and technological advancements
5.UI/UX Designers craft visually appealing and functionally effective user interfaces, designing user experiences that optimize interaction and satisfaction within software applications

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that offer a unified environment for efficient software development, including code editors, debuggers, and testing frameworks that  accelerating the software development process, exemplified by Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.
Control Systems (VCS provide a systematic approach to managing code revisions, enabling teams to collaborate effectively and maintain a comprehensive history of project changes.eg git and surbversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing Requirements:Variations in requirements throughout the software development lifecycle may induce scope expansion and project schedule slippage.
    strategies:Embrace Agile Methodologies-reak down the project into smaller, manageable iterations (sprints). This allows for frequent feedback and adjustments

2. Strict deadlines: can force rushed development, risking software quality
    strategies: Prioritize and Scope Effectively Focusing on delivering the core functionality first. Defer non-essential features to later iterations.

3.Technical debt: Accumulated technical debt, stemming from suboptimal choices, hinders development and significantly increases long-term maintenance expenses
     strategies:Technical debt arises from shortcuts and compromises that degrade software quality. By actively implementing and reassessment of project goals and timelines to enforce 
     quality standards and assurance practices, this can both prevent new debt and systematically address existing issues.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing: is a software testing method where individual, isolated units of source code (typically functions, methods, or classes) are rigorously tested to verify that they function as intended. The goal is to ensure that each unit performs its specific task correctly, independently of other parts of the system. Unit tests are automated, written by developers, and executed frequently, often as part of the development process.
2.Integration testing: is a software testing phase that focuses on verifying the interactions and interfaces between integrated software components or subsystems. It aims to detect defects that arise when these units are combined and communicate with each other. Unlike unit testing, which isolates individual components, integration testing examines the flow of data and control between modules, ensuring they work together as designed. This includes testing APIs, services, databases, and other external interfaces, validating that the integrated system meets its specified requirements."
3.System testing: is a comprehensive software testing phase that evaluates the complete, integrated software system against its specified requirements. It goes beyond individual components or interfaces, focusing on the overall functionality, performance, security, and usability of the system as a whole. System testing validates that the system meets its end-to-end requirements and behaves as expected in a production-like environment
4.Acceptance testing: validates that the software meets user requirements and business needs, ensuring it's ready for deployment and adoption by the intended users
      importance:These measures enable early defect detection and remediation throughout the software development lifecycle, resulting in significantly higher-quality software products 
      that meet stakeholder expectations

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the strategic design and optimization of input prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) towards desired outputs, encompassing the careful selection of words, provision of context, and iterative refinement. It bridges the gap between human intent and AI capability by crafting effective instructions, supplying relevant background information, and adjusting prompts through experimentation, ultimately enabling users to harness the full potential of generative AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague-"provide an analysis no geopolitics"
improved-"Provide an analysis of the key geopolitical events shaping international relations in the past six months, including their potential long-term consequences to South Africa"
